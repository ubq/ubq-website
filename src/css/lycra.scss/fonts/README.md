#Lycra V0.0.1
Version numbering should follow the semantic versioning scheme.
It follows X.Y.Z-buildNo
* Increment Z when you fix something.
* Increment Y when you add a new feature.
* Increment Z when you break backwards compatability or add major features
* Use the buildNo to differentiate between builds off the same branch, and to differentiate between development, test and production builds
